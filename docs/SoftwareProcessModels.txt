Here below are the pros and cons of "Waterfall" and "Agile" models in the context of our project:
"Waterfall"
-- Pros:
    - Heavy documentation makes it easy to maintain

-- Cons:
    - Project requirements unclear, can not complete a phase without knowing all information beforehand
    - Team members roles are not interchangable
    - Does not involve the client's opinions during project creation

"Agile"
-- Pros:
    - Requirements are unclear, so using an adaptable model is perferred
    - There are two deadlines in which we have to show our progress. Using an agile approach will enable us
	to show progress to the customer
    - Roles can be changed midway to use team members skills effectively
    

-- Cons:
    - It is less predictable what the end product will be(due to changes midway)
 

After discussing with teammates, we all think the "Agile" model is more suitable for our project.
